    == Main ==
    Treat Geo As:
        When use geo to boolean curve, choose treat geo as surface or solid.
    Keep Curve:
        When treat geo as solid, geo has inside and outside, so you can choose which part of curve (inside geo or outside geo or both) will be kept.
    Outside Group:
        When treat geo as solid and keep curve Both, it will auto group the outside part of curve.
    Inside Group:
        When treat geo as solid and keep curve Both, it will auto group the inside part of curve.  
    Bounding Tolerance:
        When treat geo as solid, The node uses bounding group feature to group inside curve, so it is the precision of the bounding group feature.
    == Output Groups ==
    Intersected Curve:
        It will group the curves which be boolean by geo.
    Intersected Point:
        It will group the points which be generated by boolean feature.
