"""Creates Points or Polygons, or adds points/polys to an input."""

If an input is specified, this OP adds points and polygons to it as
specified below. If no input is specified, then it generates the points
and polygons below as a new entity.

== Extract points ==

    Used in conjunction with a point expression, the Add op can be
    useful for extracting a specific point from another op. For example,
    to extract the X, Y and Z value of the fifth point, from a [Grid
    SOP|Node:sop/grid] in _geo1_:

    {{{
    point("geo1/grid1",5,"P",0),point("geo2/grid1",5,"P",1), point("geo3/grid1",5,"P",2)
    }}}
    Points added in this way are appended to the end of the point list
    if a Source is specified. Click the Information Pop-up on the op
    Tile to find out how many points there are. For example, if you have
    added two points and there are 347 points (from 0 to 346), you have
    added the last two point numbers: 345 and 346.

== Create a specific number of points ==

    Create an Add SOP and set it to create a single point, then append a
    [Copy SOP|Node:sop/copy] and set its number of copies to the
    (possibly animated) number of points you want.

    This works correctly even when number of points is 0, unlike some
    other approaches.

    == Points ==

        Overview:
            The three leftmost input fields represent the X,Y and Z
            coordinates of the point. The last input field represents
            the spline weight of the point. If the point is later used
            to create a spline (NURBS or Bezier) primitive, the weight
            will influence the shape of the primitive and may cause that
            primitive to become rational. Polygons and metaballs are not
            affected by this weight.

            X, Y, Z, and W can be constants (numbers) or variables.

        Delete Geometry But Keep the Points:
            This will destroy all the polygons, NURBs, and other
            primitives, leaving only the points intact.

    == Polygons: By Pattern ==

        Overview:
            Create a fixed number of polygons by specifying a point
            pattern for each polygon Enter connection lists here to
            create polygons.

            {{{
            {from}-{to}[:{every}][,{of}]
            eg1: 1 2 3 4
            eg2: 1 3-15 16 8
            eg3: 1-234 820-410 235-409
            eg4: 0-15:2
            eg5: 0-15:2,3
            }}}

    == Polygons: By Group ==

        Overview:
            Create as many polygons as determined by the group field and
            by the grouping/skipping rules.
        Group:
            Subset of points to be connected.
        Add:
            Optionally join subgroups of points.
        N:
            #channels: /inc

            Increment to use for subgroup joining.
        Attribute:
            If group by attribute is specified, this attribute will be
            used to determine how to connect the polygons within the
            group. Points with the same attribute value will be
            connected together. The connection order will respect the
            point order of the group.
        Remove Unused Points:
            Keep only the connected points.

    == Particles ==
	Overview:
	    Allows you to create a particle system out of a collection
	    of points.  Note that this will not create all the
	    attributes you may want on a particle system.  It is
	    useful when you have a collection of points you wish to
	    flag as a particle system for other operations, such as
	    the Initial State, or as a source in DOPs.

	    To convert all your geometry into particles, turn on the __Keep
	    Points but Delete Primitives__ checkbox on the __Points__ tab and then
	    enable this with a blank group field.

	Add Particle System:
	    Controls whether a particle system primitive is created.

	Particle Group:
	    The points to add to the particle system.  These are added
	    in the order specified.  If this field is left blank, all points will be
	    added to the particle system.

	Add Unused Points to Particle System:
	    If no particle primitives exist, one will be created.

	    All points that are not part of any primitive will be appended to
	    the first particle primitive.
