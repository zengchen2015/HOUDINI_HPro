""" A node to create detail attribute from target node's "Multiparm Block" parameter. """

NOTE:
    Must say thanks to [海棠|https://vimeo.com/particleflow/]
    
== Why made such a HDA ==
It is the only way to get "Multiparm Block" parameter in for-loop with a compile block.
    
@parameters
    Op with Iteration:
        Specified metadata node which has detail iteration attribute.
    Iteration Attribute:
        The default iteration attribute is "iteration", you can fill with other detail int attribute.
    Iteration Shift:
        You can shift the int value from the iteration attribute by yourself to match the "First Instance" of the multiparm. For example, the multiparm's "First Instance" is 1, because the default iteration attribute is start at 0, so the Iteration Shift must be set to 1.
    Op with Multiparm:
        The node which has "Multiparm Block" parameter, it often be the parent node.
    Full Path:
        The full path of the *Op with Multiparm*, just show your the path, it can not be custom changed.
        
    == Create Attribute	 ==
    Create Attribute:
        Create attribute from the parameters in "Multiparm Block" (from the Op with Multiparm).
    Parm Name From Multiparm:
        For example, it is the target "Multiparm Block" parameter, the "Blend Mode" parameter's name is "blend_mode#"
        [Image:/images/create_detail_attr-for_loop1.png]
        So will fill with "blend_mode" here.

    Parm Type:
        Also use the "Blend Mode" parameter, it is a menu type parameter, which imply an *int* type. So the parameter type is int.
    Detail Attribute:
        Get the "Multiparameter Block" parameter's value and type, then write it into a detail attribute. This is the detail attribute'name.
